# Your Article Title Here

Opening hook: Your compelling first paragraph that grabs attention and sets up the problem you're addressing. Be direct and confrontational.

This isn't another pitch for a solution. This is about the real problem nobody wants to talk about.

## 01. The Problem Nobody Admits

First section content explaining the core issue. Use specific examples and data.

| Value | Label | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 68% | of capability goes unused | Industry Report 2024 |
| $30B | wasted annually | Research Study |
| 47% | report burnout | Professional Survey |

These aren't abstractions. They represent real people caught in organizational dysfunction.

## 02. What's Really Happening

Second section diving deeper into the problem mechanics.

> "A powerful quote that illustrates the point you're making."
> — Anonymous Professional, Company Type

- First observation about the situation
- Second observation with more detail
- Third observation tying it together
- Fourth observation with implications

## 03. The Human Cost

Third section making it personal with specific personas.

### Persona: Alex

**Role:** Operations Manager

Promised visibility and control. Reality: maintains workarounds to reconcile what systems say versus what's real. Spends off-hours fixing data.

**Cost:** 15+ hours/week on reconciliation. Considering leaving the field.

### Persona: Jordan

**Role:** Data Analyst

Hired to unlock insights. Reality: spends 80% of time cleaning data that should have been structured correctly.

**Cost:** Zero strategic analysis. Team sees them as slow when they're drowning.

## 04. The Real Problem

Fourth section identifying root causes.

1. Process gaps blamed on tools: Instead of fixing workflows, organizations buy new software.
2. Organizational friction invisible: Incentives are misaligned and tools can't fix that.
3. Technical debt compounds: Every workaround creates two more. Nobody budgets for cleanup.
4. Truth-telling disincentivized: People who see problems are punished for raising them.

## 05. What Now?

Final section with actionable guidance.

Stop doing X. Start with:

- First action item with clear guidance
- Second action item explaining the approach
- Third action item with expected outcome
- Fourth action item connecting to bigger picture

The bottom line: Your main argument summarized in one powerful statement. This is the key insight readers should take away.

Your choice.
