# When will organization stop talking about Email ROI – it's such a misleading stat

Organizations are unlikely to stop talking about Email ROI anytime soon, despite its misleading nature. Here's why:

1. High ROI figures are appealing: Email marketing's average ROI of 38:1 or \$42 for every \$1 spent is an attractive statistic that marketers love to tout[^1][^6]. These high numbers make email marketing seem incredibly effective and efficient.
2. Misinterpretation of high ROI: Many brands interpret high ROI as a sign of success, when in reality it often indicates underinvestment in email marketing[^1]. This misunderstanding perpetuates the focus on ROI as a key metric.
3. Difficulty in measurement: Only 30% of brands can measure their email marketing ROI well or very well[^1]. This lack of accurate measurement leads to continued reliance on potentially misleading ROI figures.
4. Psychological impact: The high ROI numbers create a psychological hurdle, making it difficult for some brands to believe or dismiss these statistics as hype[^2].
5. Misalignment with business goals: Focusing on ROI can lead to complacency and reduced investment in email marketing, rather than driving higher absolute returns[^1].

However, there are signs that the industry is beginning to recognize the limitations of Email ROI:

1. Shift in focus: More sophisticated email marketing programs are moving away from maximizing return rates to maximizing overall returns[^1].
2. Recognition of underinvestment: Some experts argue that extremely high ROI figures indicate serious underinvestment in email marketing[^2].
3. Emphasis on other metrics: There's a growing understanding that engagement metrics like opens and clicks, as well as revenue and customer metrics, may be more valuable than ROI alone[^2].

Until organizations widely adopt a more nuanced approach to email marketing performance measurement, the focus on ROI is likely to persist. However, as awareness of its limitations grows, we may see a gradual shift away from this misleading statistic in the coming years.
