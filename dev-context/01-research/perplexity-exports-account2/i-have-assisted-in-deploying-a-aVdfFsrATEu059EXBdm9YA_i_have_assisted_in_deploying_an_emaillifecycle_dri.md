# Email Drip Campaign Performance Evaluation

## Current Campaign Performance Analysis

Your email drip campaign shows promising results but faces several critical statistical and operational challenges that require immediate attention.

**Campaign Overview:**

- Total enrolled users: 665
- Holdout group: 78 users (11.7%)
- Email treatment group: 587 users
- Actual email recipients: 414 users (62% of enrolled)

**Conversion Performance:**

- Holdout group: 24 conversions from 78 users (30.8%)
- Email group: 218 conversions from 587 users (37.1%)
- **Conversion rate lift: 6.3 percentage points**


## Statistical Significance Assessment

The current results **do not achieve statistical significance** at the 95% confidence level[^1][^2]. Based on statistical analysis of your conversion data:

- **Z-score: 1.098**
- **P-value: 0.272**
- **Statistical significance: NO**

To achieve reliable statistical significance with the observed effect size (6.3% difference), you would need approximately **868 users per group**[^3][^4]. Your current sample sizes fall significantly short:

- Email group: 587 users (needs 281 more)
- Holdout group: 78 users (needs 790 more)

This means your current results could be due to random variation rather than the true effect of your email campaign[^5][^6].

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Email Delivery Problems

Only 414 out of 665 enrolled users (62%) actually received emails[^1]. This delivery gap creates several problems:

- **Compromised test integrity**: Users assigned to the email group who don't receive emails dilute your treatment effect
- **Reduced statistical power**: Lower effective sample size means harder to detect true differences
- **Skewed results**: May underestimate the true impact of your email campaign


### 2. Inadequate Holdout Group Size

Your current holdout represents 11.7% of total users, which is within the standard range of 10-20% for A/B testing[^7][^8]. However, given the small absolute size (78 users), it lacks sufficient power for reliable conclusions[^5][^4].

### 3. Premature Decision Making

Making strategic decisions based on statistically insignificant results risks:

- **False positives**: Believing the campaign works when it doesn't
- **Missed opportunities**: Potentially stopping a campaign that could be effective with proper execution
- **Resource misallocation**: Investing in campaigns without proven ROI[^2][^9]


## Email Drip Campaign Performance Context

Your campaign shows alignment with industry benchmarks for drip campaign effectiveness. Research indicates that drip campaigns typically outperform single-send emails significantly:

- **Open rates**: 80% higher than single-send emails[^10]
- **Revenue generation**: Up to 320% more revenue than traditional campaigns[^11]
- **Engagement**: Higher click-through and conversion rates due to personalized timing[^12][^13]

The 6.3% conversion rate difference you're observing, while not statistically significant yet, aligns with the expected performance improvements from well-executed drip campaigns[^14][^15].

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

**1. Fix Email Delivery Issues**

- Investigate why 173 users (26% of email group) aren't receiving emails
- Address technical problems with email sending infrastructure
- Ensure proper list hygiene and deliverability practices[^1][^16]

**2. Extend Test Duration**

- Continue running the campaign for at least **2-4 more weeks** to reach adequate sample sizes[^16][^17]
- Most email engagement occurs within 24-48 hours, but conversion tracking should extend longer[^17][^18]

**3. Maintain Current Holdout Size**

- **Do not reduce the holdout group** as the content owner suggests
- The current 11.7% holdout is appropriate for standard A/B testing[^7][^8]
- Reducing it further would worsen your statistical power problem


### Strategic Considerations

**1. Sample Size Planning**
For future campaigns, plan for minimum sample sizes of:

- **1,000+ users per group** for reliable A/B testing[^1][^5]
- **868+ users per group** for detecting 6% conversion rate differences[^3][^4]

**2. Test Duration Guidelines**

- **Minimum 1-2 weeks** for conversion-focused email tests[^16][^17]
- **5-14 days** is optimal for most email A/B tests[^18]
- Monitor business cycles and seasonal variations[^1][^19]

**3. Success Metrics Focus**
Given iOS 15's impact on open rate reliability, focus on:

- **Conversion rate**: Most reliable indicator of campaign success[^20]
- **Revenue per email**: Direct business impact measurement[^21]
- **Click-through rates**: Better engagement indicator than opens[^21][^20]


## Alternative Approaches

If you need faster decision-making:

**1. Increase Sample Size**

- Enroll more users to reach statistical significance sooner
- Consider expanding to additional user segments[^5][^4]

**2. Sequential Testing**

- Use modern statistical methods that don't require predetermined sample sizes
- Monitor results continuously for early stopping opportunities[^3]

**3. Segmented Analysis**

- Analyze results by user characteristics to identify high-performing segments
- May reveal clearer effects in specific user groups[^19][^9]


## Conclusion

Your email drip campaign shows promising directional results with a 6.3% conversion rate improvement, but lacks the statistical rigor needed for confident decision-making. The content owner's suggestion to reduce the holdout group would be counterproductive and further compromise your ability to measure true campaign effectiveness[^7][^8].

**Recommended path forward**: Fix delivery issues, maintain current test structure, and continue data collection until achieving statistical significance. This approach will provide reliable insights for scaling your email marketing program effectively[^1][^9].

The investment in proper testing methodology will pay dividends through more confident optimization decisions and better campaign performance measurement[^2][^5].
