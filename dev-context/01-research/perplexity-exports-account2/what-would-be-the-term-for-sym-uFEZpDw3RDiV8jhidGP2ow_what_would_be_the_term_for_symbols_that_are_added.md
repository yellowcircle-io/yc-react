# What would be the term for symbols that are added to an email address for testing purposes be called. For example: hello+test@email.com, the "+test" part

The term for the part of an email address like "+test" in "hello+test@email.com" is most commonly referred to as a **plus tag**, **subaddress**, or **plus address**. The technique itself is called **plus addressing**, **email subaddressing**, or **email aliasing**[^1][^2][^3].

The "+test" portion is specifically known as the **tag** or **identifier** after the plus sign, and it allows users to create variations of their main email address for testing, filtering, or tracking purposes[^1][^4][^2].

In summary, the general terms are:

- **Plus addressing** or **email subaddressing**: The technique of adding a plus sign and a tag.
- **Plus tag** or **tag**: The part after the plus sign (e.g., "test" in "+test").
- **Subaddress**: The full "username+tag" local part before the "@" symbol.

These are widely supported by email providers like Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, Yahoo Mail, and Proton Mail[^1][^2][^3].
