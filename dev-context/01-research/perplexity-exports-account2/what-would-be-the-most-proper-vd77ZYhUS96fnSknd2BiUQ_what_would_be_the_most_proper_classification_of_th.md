# Email Campaign Classification: Drip vs. Nurture for Event Attendee Follow-up

Based on comprehensive research into email marketing taxonomy and event follow-up best practices, the most proper classification for your described email sequence would be a **drip campaign**.

## Key Characteristics Supporting Drip Classification

### Sequential, Time-Based Structure

Your email sequence follows the hallmark characteristics of a drip campaign: a **predetermined sequence** where the first email addresses event attendance, followed by sales/marketing messages aimed at conversion and upselling. This structured progression is delivered on a **time-based schedule** rather than being triggered by individual recipient behaviors during the campaign.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### Fixed Content Path

Drip campaigns are defined by their **static nature** - each campaign contains a set of pre-determined emails in a specific sequence. Your scenario fits this model perfectly, as all event attendees would receive the same progression from attendance acknowledgment to sales-focused content, regardless of their individual engagement levels with each email.[^2][^3][^1]

### Broad Segment Approach

While your emails target the specific segment of event attendees, they treat everyone within that segment uniformly. This broad segmentation approach is characteristic of drip campaigns, which **send the same sequence to all members of a defined group**, as opposed to nurture campaigns that adapt content based on individual behaviors.[^5][^6][^7][^2]

## Industry Standards for Event Follow-up

Post-event email sequences are consistently classified as **drip campaigns** in marketing literature. The typical structure you've described - starting with event-related communication and progressing to sales/marketing content - aligns with established **post-event drip campaign best practices**.[^8][^9][^10]

These campaigns commonly follow structured timelines: initial acknowledgment (Day 1-2), followed by value-added content and sales messaging in subsequent emails. This predetermined cadence represents the **time-sensitive and fixed sequence** nature that defines drip campaigns.[^9][^1]

## Distinguishing from Nurture Campaigns

While your sequence has relationship-building elements aimed at conversion, it lacks the key characteristics that would classify it as a nurture campaign:

- **Behavioral triggers**: Nurture campaigns adapt based on recipient actions like clicks, downloads, or website visits[^3][^5]
- **Dynamic content**: Messages change based on individual engagement patterns[^6][^11]
- **Personalized pathways**: Different recipients may receive different content based on their behaviors[^12][^3]

Your sequence, while targeted to event attendees, delivers the same predetermined content progression to all recipients, making it fundamentally a **drip campaign with targeted segmentation**.

## Conclusion

The **drip campaign** classification is most appropriate for your event attendee email sequence. This categorization aligns with industry standards for post-event marketing automation, reflects the time-based and sequential nature of your content delivery, and matches the broad segment approach you've described.[^10][^7][^1][^2][^3]
