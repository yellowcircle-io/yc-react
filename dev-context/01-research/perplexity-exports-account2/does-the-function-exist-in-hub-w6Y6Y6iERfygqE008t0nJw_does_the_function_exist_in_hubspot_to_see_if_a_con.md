# Does the function exist in HubSpot to see if a contact was ever entered into a workflow? I thought it existed

Yes, HubSpot does provide functionality to see if a contact was ever entered into a workflow. There are a few ways to access this information:

1. Workflow Enrollment History: You can review the enrollment history of contacts in a specific workflow using an interactive diagram in the workflow editor[^7].
2. Contact Record Activities: You can customize the activities shown on a contact's record to include workflow enrollments[^3].
3. Workflow Action Logs: For a detailed log of a specific contact's actions within a workflow, you can navigate to the workflow, click on the Action logs tab, and select the contact[^3].
4. Enrollment History Tab: In the workflow details, there's an "Enrollment history" tab where you can hover over an event and click "Why did this enroll" to review a specific object's enrollment details[^6].

While there isn't a single comprehensive view of all workflows a contact has ever been in, these methods allow you to trace a contact's workflow history. However, it's important to note that the historical data available may be limited, typically covering the last 30 days[^2].
