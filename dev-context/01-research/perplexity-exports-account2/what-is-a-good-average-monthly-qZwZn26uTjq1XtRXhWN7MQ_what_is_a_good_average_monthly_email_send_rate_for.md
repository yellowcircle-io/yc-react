# What is a good average monthly email send rate for a Sass model company currently

For a SaaS company, a good average monthly email send rate is 9-16 emails per month. This frequency has been shown to yield the highest email ROI, delivering an impressive return of 46:1[^5]. This sweet spot balances engagement with avoiding overwhelming subscribers.

However, it's important to note that the ideal frequency can vary depending on your specific audience and industry. Here are some additional considerations:

1. 65% of SMB marketers send emails either daily or weekly (32% daily, 33% weekly)[^3]. This suggests that more frequent communication can be effective for some businesses.
2. The content and purpose of your emails matter. For example, abandoned cart emails see high open rates of 50.5%[^3], indicating that targeted, timely emails can be sent more frequently without annoying subscribers.
3. Monitor your engagement metrics closely. The average email open rate across industries is 37.27%[^3]. If your open rates start to decline, it may be a sign to adjust your sending frequency.
4. Segment your audience and personalize your approach. Some users may prefer more frequent updates, while others might engage better with less frequent, more substantial content[^4].

Remember, the key is to provide value with each email and to test different frequencies to find what works best for your specific SaaS product and audience[^3].
