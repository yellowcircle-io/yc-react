## Can You See Which Email Clients Users Are Using in HubSpot (Without Checking Per Campaign/Email)?

**Summary:**
HubSpot does provide some information about which email clients recipients use to open emails, but this data is only available on a *per-email* or *per-campaign* basis. There is currently no built-in, account-wide dashboard or report that aggregates email client usage across all campaigns or emails.

### Details

**Per-Email/Campaign Reporting:**

- When you analyze the performance of a specific marketing email in HubSpot, you can view a breakdown of opens and clicks by email client (such as Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.) in the email's performance details[^6].
- This information is found under the “Opens/Clicks by email client” section within the email performance report. However, you must access each email individually to see this data[^6].

**No Global Email Client Report:**

- HubSpot does not offer a native, cross-campaign or account-wide report that shows aggregate statistics of which email clients your audience uses most[^4][^6].
- Users have requested this feature in the HubSpot Community, referencing tools like Mailchimp that provide a summary of top email clients across all campaigns[^4]. As of the latest updates, this feature has not been implemented.

**Exporting and Workarounds:**

- You can export recipient engagement data (including device and client information, where available) from individual emails, and then aggregate this data manually outside of HubSpot (e.g., in Excel)[^6].
- There is no mention in HubSpot documentation or community forums of third-party integrations or apps that provide a consolidated email client usage dashboard within HubSpot.

**Limitations:**

- Not all email clients provide device or client reporting data due to privacy or security reasons. In such cases, HubSpot will list these as "Other"[^6].
- The available data is more reliable for marketing emails than for one-to-one sales emails, as tracking is more robust in the marketing email tool[^1][^6].

## Conclusion

You can see which email clients users are using in HubSpot, but only by checking the performance report for each individual email or campaign. There is no built-in way to view this data in aggregate across all emails or campaigns within HubSpot[^4][^6]. For a consolidated view, you would need to manually export and combine data from each email report.
