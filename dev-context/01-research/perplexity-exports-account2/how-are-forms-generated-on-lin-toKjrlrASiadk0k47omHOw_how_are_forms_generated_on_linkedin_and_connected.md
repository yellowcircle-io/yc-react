## How LinkedIn Forms Are Generated and Connected to HubSpot

**LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms** are a powerful tool for capturing leads directly within the LinkedIn platform, and HubSpot provides seamless integration to automatically sync those leads into your CRM or marketing automation workflows. Here’s how the process works from creation to integration:

---

**Creating LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms**

- In LinkedIn Campaign Manager, you can create Lead Gen Forms when setting up a new campaign with a lead generation objective.
- Navigate to **Assets > Lead Gen Forms**, then click **Create form**.
- Complete the form sections, including form details, lead details \& questions, confirmation message, and any hidden fields.
- These forms are typically attached to Sponsored Content or Message Ads, and are pre-filled with the user’s LinkedIn profile information for a frictionless experience[^1][^5][^7][^11].

---

**How Forms Are Connected to HubSpot**

There are two main ways to connect LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms to HubSpot:

### 1. **Native HubSpot Integration**

- **Connect Accounts:** In HubSpot, go to your Ads dashboard and connect your LinkedIn Ads account. You must have appropriate admin permissions on both platforms (Super Admin, Content Admin, or Lead Gen Forms Manager in LinkedIn)[^2][^10].
- **Automatic Sync:** Once connected, any existing and new LinkedIn Lead Gen campaigns will appear in HubSpot. You can choose to sync all leads from the past 90 days or only new leads going forward[^4].
- **Lead Flow:** When a LinkedIn user submits a Lead Gen Form, their information is automatically synced into HubSpot as a new contact. This data appears in your contacts list and can trigger workflows, lists, or reporting in HubSpot[^2][^4][^10].
- **Troubleshooting:** If leads are not syncing, check permissions and integration settings. HubSpot offers troubleshooting steps to resolve common sync issues[^10].


### 2. **Third-Party Integration Tools**

- **LeadsBridge, Zapier, etc.:** These platforms allow for more customized integrations, such as mapping specific fields or triggering additional actions.
- **Setup:** Authorize both your LinkedIn and HubSpot accounts, select the Lead Gen Form as the source, and HubSpot as the destination.
- **Field Mapping:** Map LinkedIn form fields to HubSpot contact properties to ensure data flows correctly. Some tools allow for data formatting or additional automation steps[^3][^8].

---

**Key Points in the Integration Process**

- **Form Submission:** When a user submits a LinkedIn Lead Gen Form, their data is captured instantly and can be routed directly into HubSpot.
- **Data Handling:** HubSpot can trigger workflows, assign leads, or segment contacts based on the incoming form data.
- **Testing:** After setup, submit a test lead via a LinkedIn form and confirm it appears in HubSpot to ensure the connection is working[^4].
- **Manual Sync:** If needed, you can manually refresh or re-sync forms in HubSpot to pull in any missed leads[^6].
