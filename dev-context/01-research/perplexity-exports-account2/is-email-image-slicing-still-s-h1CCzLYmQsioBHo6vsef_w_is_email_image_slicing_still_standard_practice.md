# Email Image Slicing: No Longer Standard Practice in 2025

Email image slicing—the practice of cutting large graphics into smaller pieces and reassembling them in HTML tables—has largely fallen out of favor as standard practice in modern email marketing. While still occasionally used in specific scenarios, this technique is now generally discouraged due to significant drawbacks that have become more pronounced as email technology and user expectations have evolved.[^1][^2]

## Why Image Slicing Has Declined

### Deliverability and Spam Filter Issues

Modern spam filters view image-heavy emails with suspicion, as this technique was historically used by spammers to hide malicious content. The recommended text-to-image ratio for optimal deliverability is now 60-80% text to 20-40% images. Emails consisting primarily of sliced images can trigger spam filters and reduce inbox placement rates.[^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8]

### Accessibility and User Experience Problems

Image slicing creates significant accessibility barriers that violate modern standards. Screen readers cannot interpret sliced images effectively, making emails inaccessible to users with visual impairments. With 99.97% of HTML emails containing serious accessibility issues according to the Email Markup Consortium's 2024 report, practices that worsen accessibility are increasingly avoided.[^9][^1]

### Mobile and Responsive Design Challenges

Sliced images perform poorly on mobile devices, where over 80% of emails are now opened. These images often stack incorrectly on smaller screens and don't adapt to different screen sizes. Mobile-first design principles, which are now standard practice, favor single-column layouts with responsive elements rather than rigid sliced image grids.[^2][^10][^11][^12]

### Image Blocking Concerns

Many email clients still block images by default for security and performance reasons. While Gmail began displaying images automatically in 2013, studies show that 43% of Gmail users still read emails without images enabled. When images are blocked, sliced image emails appear completely blank unless proper alt text is implemented.[^13][^14][^15][^16]

## Current Best Practices Instead

### HTML-Coded Responsive Emails

Modern email development prioritizes HTML-coded emails with CSS styling that can adapt to different screen sizes and maintain functionality when images are blocked. This approach provides better accessibility, searchability, and user experience across all devices.[^17][^18]

### Balanced Content Approach

Industry experts now recommend a balanced approach using live text combined with optimized images. This ensures emails remain readable and engaging regardless of image blocking or slow loading conditions.[^7][^19]

### Single-Column, Mobile-First Design

The trend has shifted toward simple, single-column layouts that work well across all devices and email clients. These designs prioritize readability and accessibility over complex visual arrangements.[^10][^20]

## Limited Modern Use Cases

Image slicing is now primarily used only in very specific situations, such as when working with clients who lack HTML coding skills or for very simple promotional emails where the trade-offs are acceptable. Even then, it's considered a fallback option rather than a best practice.[^21][^2]

Most professional email marketers and major brands have moved away from image slicing in favor of more sustainable, accessible, and effective email design approaches that align with current deliverability requirements and user expectations.[^22][^17]
