# Is it possible for a drafted or scheduled message to be deleted or removed by an entity besides the one that created it

Yes, it is possible for a drafted or scheduled message to be deleted or removed by an entity other than the one that created it, depending on the platform and permissions set[^1][^2][^5].

In many messaging and collaboration platforms, administrators or users with specific permissions can manage messages created by others:

1. Slack: Workspace owners and admins can set permissions for message editing and deletion. They can restrict the ability to delete messages to only owners and admins, or allow all members to delete their own messages[^1].
2. Microsoft Outlook: Administrators can manage scheduled messages. If a message is in the Deleted Items folder, it will not be sent at the scheduled time[^2].
3. Discord: Users with the "Manage Messages" permission can delete anyone's messages, regardless of hierarchy. This means a moderator could potentially delete an admin's message[^3].
4. Enterprise systems: In many organizations, IT administrators or those with appropriate access rights can manage, delete, or remove messages created by other users[^7].

It's important to note that the ability to delete or remove messages created by others is typically governed by system permissions and organizational policies. The exact capabilities may vary depending on the specific platform, software version, and configured settings.
