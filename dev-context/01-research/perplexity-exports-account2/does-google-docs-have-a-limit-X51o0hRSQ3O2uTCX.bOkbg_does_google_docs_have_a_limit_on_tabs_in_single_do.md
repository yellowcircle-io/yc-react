# Does google docs have a limit on tabs in single document

Yes, Google Docs does have a limit on the number of tabs in a single document. According to the information available, users can create up to **100 tabs** in a document. Additionally, tabs can be nested up to three levels, allowing for further organization with subtabs[^6]. However, there is no specific mention of increasing this limit beyond 100 tabs as of now[^8].

It's worth noting that while the tab limit is 100, the overall character limit for a Google Doc remains at 1,024,000 characters, regardless of the number of tabs[^2].
