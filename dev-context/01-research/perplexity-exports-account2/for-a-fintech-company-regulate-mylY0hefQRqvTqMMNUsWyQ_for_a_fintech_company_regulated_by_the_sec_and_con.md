# For a fintech company regulated by the SEC and connected with banks, such as Rho, is it legal to hold the financials of customers in Marketing Automation Platforms like HubSpot? In working at similar organizations, I thought the answers was a hard no, correct

For a fintech company regulated by the SEC and connected with banks, such as Rho, it is generally not legal to hold customers' financial information in Marketing Automation Platforms like HubSpot. Your understanding of a "hard no" is correct[^1][^4][^5].

## Regulatory Considerations

**SEC Regulation S-P**: This regulation requires financial institutions to protect customer records and information[^6]. It limits how and when institutions can disclose consumer information and mandates written policies to safeguard customer data[^6].

**Data Privacy and Security**: Fintech companies must comply with strict data protection laws like GDPR and CCPA, ensuring customer data is properly collected, stored, used, and shared[^1][^2].

**PCI DSS Compliance**: For payment transactions, financial institutions must adhere to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements[^5].

## Risks and Compliance Issues

Storing financial data in marketing platforms like HubSpot presents several compliance risks:

1. **Data Security**: Marketing platforms may not have the level of security required for sensitive financial information[^2][^5].
2. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: It could violate SEC regulations, GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws[^1][^4].
3. **Unauthorized Access**: Marketing teams typically don't have the clearance to access sensitive financial data[^5].
4. **Data Breach Liability**: In case of a breach, the company could face severe penalties and reputational damage[^2][^5].

## Best Practices

Instead of using marketing platforms for financial data, fintech companies should:

1. Use dedicated, secure systems for storing and processing financial information[^1][^5].
2. Implement strict data segmentation and access controls[^5].
3. Ensure end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data[^5].
4. Regularly audit and update data handling practices to maintain compliance[^4][^6].

In conclusion, storing customers' financial information in marketing automation platforms like HubSpot is not compliant with regulatory requirements for SEC-regulated fintech companies connected with banks[^1][^4][^5].
