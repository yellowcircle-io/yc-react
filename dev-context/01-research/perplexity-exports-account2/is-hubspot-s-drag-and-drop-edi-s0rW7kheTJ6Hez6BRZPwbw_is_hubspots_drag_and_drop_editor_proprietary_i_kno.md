## HubSpot’s Drag-and-Drop Editor: Proprietary or Third-Party?

**HubSpot’s drag-and-drop editor is a proprietary tool developed and maintained by HubSpot, not an integrated third-party solution like BeeFree (BEE) used by Iterable and others.**

### Evidence and Details

- **Native Development:** HubSpot’s documentation and user experiences consistently describe the drag-and-drop editor as a core, built-in feature of the platform. It is accessible within HubSpot’s own Design Manager alongside other proprietary tools, such as their custom module system and the HubL templating language[^1][^7]. There is no mention in official documentation or community discussions of a third-party provider powering this editor.
- **Custom Module Support:** Users can build custom modules specifically for the HubSpot drag-and-drop builder, which further indicates a proprietary system rather than a third-party integration[^5][^7].
- **Export/Import Workflows:** While platforms like Iterable directly integrate with BeeFree for design and import workflows[^2][^8], HubSpot’s workflow is internal. BeeFree does offer an export-to-HubSpot feature, but this is an external workflow: users design in BeeFree and then export/import into HubSpot[^4]. This does not mean HubSpot’s native editor is BeeFree-powered.


### Third-Party Integration: BeeFree and HubSpot

- **BeeFree as an External Tool:** BeeFree promotes itself as a way to “enhance productivity” for HubSpot users by allowing designs to be created in BeeFree and then exported to HubSpot[^4]. This relationship is additive, not foundational—BeeFree does not power HubSpot’s built-in email editor.
- **Contrast with Iterable:** Iterable’s drag-and-drop editor is explicitly powered by the latest version of BeeFree (BEE), as confirmed in both Iterable’s support documentation and external reviews[^2][^8]. Iterable users can design in BeeFree and import directly or use the same editing experience within Iterable[^2][^8].


### Summary Table

| Platform | Native Editor Proprietary? | Uses BeeFree/BEE Editor? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| HubSpot | Yes | No (external only) | Native editor is proprietary; BeeFree is optional |
| Iterable | No | Yes (integrated) | Drag-and-drop editor powered by BeeFree/BEE |

## Conclusion

HubSpot’s drag-and-drop editor is proprietary and developed in-house. While BeeFree offers export options to HubSpot, the native HubSpot editor does not use BeeFree or any other third-party editor “under the hood.” In contrast, Iterable and some other platforms do rely on integrated third-party editors like BeeFree for their drag-and-drop functionality[^2][^8].
