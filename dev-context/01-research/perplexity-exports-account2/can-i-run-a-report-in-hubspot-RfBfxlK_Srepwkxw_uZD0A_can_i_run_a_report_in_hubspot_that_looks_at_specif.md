# Can I run a report in hubspot that looks at specific workflow emails sent within a give timeframe

Yes, you can run a report in HubSpot that looks at specific workflow emails sent within a given timeframe. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Use the Custom Report Builder:
Navigate to Reporting > Reports > Create report > Custom Report Builder[^7]. In the Data sources dropdown menu, select "Marketing email analytics" as your primary data source[^2].
2. Set up your report:

- Choose "Marketing email analytics" as your primary data source
- Add "Marketing email" as an additional data source
- Select the appropriate chart type (e.g., pivot table or area chart)
- Use "Delivered date" as your X-axis or time-based filter
- Add relevant metrics such as open rate, click-through rate, and delivery rate
- Use filters to focus on specific workflow emails[^2][^8]

3. Filter for workflow emails:
In the report builder, you can filter for emails sent through workflows by selecting the appropriate workflow or using the "Workflow" dropdown if available[^2][^4].
4. Specify the timeframe:
Use the date range selector in the report builder to set your desired timeframe for analysis[^2].
5. Analyze the results:
Once your report is set up, you can analyze the performance of your workflow emails within the specified timeframe. This can include metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and delivery rates[^2][^7].

Remember that while HubSpot offers robust reporting capabilities, some users have noted limitations in analyzing the best time to send emails[^5]. However, the custom report builder provides flexibility in creating reports tailored to your specific needs[^2][^7].
