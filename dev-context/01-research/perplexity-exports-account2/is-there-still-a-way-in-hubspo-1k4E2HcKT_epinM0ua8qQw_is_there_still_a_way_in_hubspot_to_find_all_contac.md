# Is there still a way in HubSpot to find all contacts with a Note on their team activity

Yes, there is still a way in HubSpot to find all contacts with a Note on their team activity as of February 2025. To accomplish this, you can create an active contact list using the following steps:

1. Navigate to Menu > Contacts > Lists[^8].
2. Create a new active list.
3. Set up a filter for "Notes" and specify the keyword or phrase related to team activity that you want to search for[^8].

This method allows you to filter contacts based on the content of their notes, including those related to team activity. Additionally, you can further refine your search by using the Analytics Tools:

1. Go to Reports > Analytics Tools > Sales Team Productivity[^4].
2. Adjust the parameters to view specific data, such as date range, sales teams, or individual sales reps[^4].

For a more comprehensive view of user activity, including notes, you can also create a custom "Team Activity" dashboard using HubSpot's default reports[^4]. This dashboard can provide up-to-date information on various activities, including notes related to team activity.

Remember that the availability of certain features may depend on your HubSpot subscription level and permissions[^4].
