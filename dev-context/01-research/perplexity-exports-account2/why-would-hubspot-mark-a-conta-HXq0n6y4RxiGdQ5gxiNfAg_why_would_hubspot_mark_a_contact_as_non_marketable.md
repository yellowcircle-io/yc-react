# Why would HubSpot mark a contact as non-marketable when submitting a form

HubSpot may mark a contact as non-marketable when submitting a form due to several reasons:

1. Default form settings: The form's default setting for new contacts might be set to "non-marketing"[^6]. This can be customized in the form's settings, where there's usually a toggle switch to set new contacts as marketing or non-marketing by default[^6].
2. Opt-in status: If the form doesn't include an explicit marketing opt-in field or the contact doesn't check it, HubSpot might default to marking the contact as non-marketing to comply with legal requirements[^3].
3. Automatic tagging configuration: Your HubSpot system might be configured to automatically tag certain contacts as non-marketing based on specific criteria or actions[^1].
4. Form API submission: If the form submission is done through the API, the marketing opt-in status can be explicitly set. If it's set to false, the contact will be marked as non-marketing[^2].
5. Bug or system error: In some cases, it could be a bug in the HubSpot system, especially if the form settings are correctly configured to mark contacts as marketing[^9].

To ensure contacts are marked as marketing when submitting a form:

- Check the form's settings and enable the option to set new contacts as marketing by default[^6].
- Include a clear opt-in field in your form for marketing communications.
- Review your HubSpot system's automatic tagging configurations.
- If the issue persists, contact HubSpot support as it may be a system bug[^9].

Remember, marking contacts as non-marketing helps manage your marketing contact limit and ensures compliance with email marketing regulations[^1][^4].
