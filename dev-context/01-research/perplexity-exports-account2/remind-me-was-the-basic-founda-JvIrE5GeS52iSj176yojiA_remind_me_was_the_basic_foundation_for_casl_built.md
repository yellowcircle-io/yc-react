# Remind me: Was the basic foundation for CASL built on the structure of GDPR

No, the basic foundation for CASL (Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation) was not built on the structure of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). CASL predates GDPR, having come into effect in 2014, while GDPR was introduced in May 2018. However, the two share similarities in their approach to consent and consumer protection, which has led to comparisons between them.

CASL focuses primarily on regulating unsolicited commercial electronic messages and preventing malware distribution within Canada. It employs an opt-in model requiring businesses to obtain explicit consent before contacting individuals with marketing communications. GDPR also emphasizes explicit consent but extends its scope significantly by regulating the collection, storage, processing, and management of personal data across all EU member states. GDPR includes additional provisions such as the "right to be forgotten," stricter rules on data processing purposes, and broader individual rights[^1][^2][^4].

While GDPR's introduction indirectly influenced Canadian privacy laws by encouraging tighter rules for meaningful consent, CASL was independently developed and is less comprehensive than GDPR in terms of personal data protection[^7]. Thus, CASL was not directly built on GDPR's structure but shares overlapping principles regarding consumer rights and consent.
