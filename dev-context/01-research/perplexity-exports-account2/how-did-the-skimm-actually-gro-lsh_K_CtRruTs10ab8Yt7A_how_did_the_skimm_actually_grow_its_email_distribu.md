# How theSkimm Built Their Email Empire and the B2B Companies Following Their Playbook

TheSkimm's journey from a \$4,000 startup to a 7-million-subscriber media powerhouse offers compelling insights into viral email list growth. More importantly, their strategies have proven surprisingly adaptable to B2B contexts, with several companies achieving remarkable success by applying similar principles. This analysis reveals how theSkimm's consumer-focused tactics translate into powerful B2B growth engines.

Comparison of theSkimm's email growth tactics with B2B companies' similar strategies

## TheSkimm's Five-Stage Growth Framework

### Stage 1: Strategic Foundation and Early Seeding (2012)

TheSkimm's founders, Danielle Weisberg and Carly Zakin, began with a **personal network leverage strategy** that many B2B companies overlook. They systematically compiled 5,500 contacts from their NBC careers, social media connections, and even email chains from Zakin's grandmother, resulting in 800 initial subscribers on launch day.[^1][^2]

The timing element was crucial—their **6 AM delivery schedule** positioned theSkimm as an integral part of subscribers' morning routines. This wasn't accidental; they chose this time specifically because a friend in finance left for work at 5:30 AM, ensuring the newsletter could be read during her commute. This **routine integration strategy** proved fundamental to building habit-forming engagement.[^2]

### Stage 2: Grassroots Marketing and PR Amplification (2012-2013)

TheSkimm's **grassroots marketing approach** was remarkably systematic. They invested in 22 American Apparel t-shirts with their logo, distributing them to friends in key markets: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, and Boston. Recipients were required to send photos wearing the shirts and display them in high-visibility locations.[^3]

The breakthrough came through **strategic PR outreach**. Rather than mass marketing, they personally contacted every news anchor, media liaison, and press agent they knew from NBC. When Hoda Kotb mentioned theSkimm on The Today Show just four days after launch, subscriber growth exploded.[^2]

### Stage 3: Ambassador Program Development (2015-2016)

The **Skimm'bassador program** represented their most scalable innovation. To become an official ambassador, subscribers needed to refer ten friends. The program offered tiered rewards and, crucially, created **exclusive community access** through invite-only Facebook and LinkedIn groups.[^2]

This community-building aspect differentiated theSkimm from simple referral programs. Ambassadors received early access to job opportunities, networking events, and insider content. By 2016, over 16,000 Skimm'bassadors were contributing to 19% of user growth.[^3]

### Stage 4: Strategic Growth Over Monetization (2012-2016)

Perhaps theSkimm's most counterintuitive decision was **rejecting early advertising opportunities**. Despite approaches from "wish-list brands," they prioritized audience growth over immediate revenue. This strategy preserved their editorial voice and created mystique around their brand-free content.[^2]

As co-founder Carly Zakin explained: "One of the best pieces of advice we got from our investors was that you can either focus on growth or monetization... We made the choice to focus on user growth".[^4]

### Stage 5: Viral Campaign Integration (2016)

TheSkimm's **"No Excuses" voter registration campaign** demonstrated how purpose-driven initiatives could accelerate growth. Partnering with Rock the Vote, they registered over 110,000 young voters, generating massive PR coverage and positioning theSkimm as more than just a newsletter—they became a trusted voice for civic engagement.[^2]

## The B2B Success Stories: Proven Analogues

### Morning Brew: The Direct B2B Parallel

Morning Brew represents the closest B2B analogue to theSkimm's success. Founded in 2015 by Alex Lieberman and Austin Rief, Morning Brew grew to 4.4 million subscribers and achieved a \$75 million acquisition by Business Insider.[^5]

**Similar Tactics Applied:**

- **University campus ambassador program**: They visited business classes at 200 colleges, training local "ambassadors" to replicate their pitch[^6]
- **Referral program excellence**: Their referral system generated 2.5 million new subscribers[^2]
- **Growth-first mentality**: Like theSkimm, they initially prioritized audience building over monetization[^7]
- **B2B pivot success**: Morning Brew's B2B revenue is expected to reach \$25 million in 2025, potentially surpassing their flagship consumer newsletter[^7]

**Key Innovation**: Morning Brew's **subject line A/B testing** process involves sending different subject lines to 30% of their audience, measuring click-through rates, and using the winner for the remaining 70%. This optimization generated an additional 43,876 clicks per newsletter.[^2]

### Dropbox: Viral Growth Through Storage Incentives

Dropbox's referral program achieved **3,900% growth in 15 months**, expanding from 100,000 to 4 million users. While initially consumer-focused, Dropbox Business adapted these principles for B2B success.[^8]

**TheSkimm-Inspired Elements:**

- **Double-sided rewards**: Both referrers and new users received 500MB of storage, mirroring theSkimm's mutual benefit approach[^9]
- **Seamless sharing integration**: Referral links were embedded directly into the onboarding process[^8]
- **Product-aligned incentives**: Storage space rewards aligned perfectly with the core product value[^9]
- **Viral loop engineering**: New users immediately encountered referral opportunities, creating self-perpetuating growth[^9]

**B2B Application**: Dropbox Business now uses **tiered storage rewards** for enterprise referrals, with small referrals earning bonus storage while enterprise-level referrals unlock custom packages.[^10]

### Notion: Template-Driven Community Growth

Notion's growth from 1 million to 100 million users demonstrates how **community-driven content** can replicate theSkimm's viral mechanics.[^11]

**Parallel Strategies:**

- **User-generated content ecosystem**: Notion's open-source template marketplace mirrors theSkimm's ambassador-generated content[^12]
- **Community-first approach**: Like theSkimm's exclusive groups, Notion built 415,000-member communities[^11]
- **Viral sharing mechanisms**: Shared templates function as branded case studies, similar to theSkimm's shareable daily content[^12]
- **31% churn as growth driver**: Notion's apparent weakness actually drives B2B expansion, as churning individuals often bring Notion into their new companies[^11]

**Revenue Impact**: Despite minimal paid advertising, Notion achieved a \$10 billion valuation with \$300 million in revenue.[^11]

### HubSpot: Educational Content as Lead Magnets

HubSpot's **free tools strategy** directly parallels theSkimm's value-first approach.[^13]

**TheSkimm-Inspired Tactics:**

- **Website Grader and free tools**: Like theSkimm's free daily newsletter, HubSpot provides immediate value before asking for commitment[^14]
- **Educational content marketing**: Their academy and certification programs mirror theSkimm's informative approach[^13]
- **Community building through events**: Annual conferences and user groups replicate theSkimm's community-building strategies[^14]


### Salesforce: Community-Driven Ecosystem Growth

Salesforce's **Trailblazer community** program demonstrates enterprise-scale application of theSkimm's community tactics.[^13]

**Adapted Strategies:**

- **Dreamforce conference**: Creates viral moments and community connections similar to theSkimm's events[^13]
- **Partner advocacy programs**: Business partners become evangelists, paralleling theSkimm's ambassador model[^13]
- **Educational content (Trailhead)**: Free learning platform builds community while demonstrating product value[^13]


## Key Success Factors for B2B Implementation

### 1. Community Over Customers

The most successful B2B companies using theSkimm-inspired tactics focus on **building communities rather than customer lists**. Morning Brew's success stems from treating subscribers as community members first, customers second.[^15]

### 2. Product-Aligned Incentives

Effective B2B referral programs offer rewards that enhance the core product experience. Dropbox's storage rewards and HubSpot's educational resources directly support user success rather than offering generic incentives.[^16]

### 3. Viral Loop Integration

TheSkimm embedded sharing opportunities into natural user workflows. B2B companies achieve similar results by integrating referral mechanisms into onboarding, product usage milestones, and customer success touchpoints.[^2][^17]

### 4. Content as Distribution

Notion's template marketplace and Morning Brew's shareable business insights demonstrate how **valuable content becomes a distribution mechanism**. Each piece of content carries inherent viral potential while providing genuine utility.[^12]

## Measurable Impact and ROI

The financial implications of theSkimm-inspired B2B strategies are substantial:

- **Morning Brew**: \$75 million acquisition, \$25 million projected B2B revenue[^7]
- **Dropbox**: 3,900% growth, eventual \$10+ billion valuation[^9]
- **Notion**: \$10 billion valuation with minimal advertising spend[^11]
- **HubSpot**: Multi-billion dollar valuation built on inbound marketing principles[^13]

**Referral Program Statistics** support these approaches:

- 84% of B2B buyers begin their journey through referrals[^16]
- Companies with referral programs report 71% higher conversion rates[^16]
- B2B referral programs achieve 55% "highly effective" ratings compared to 35% for companies without programs[^18]


## Implementation Framework for B2B Companies

### Phase 1: Foundation Building

1. **Identify your "routine integration" opportunity**: Where does your product fit into users' daily workflows?
2. **Map your initial network**: Leverage existing relationships systematically
3. **Create exclusivity**: Build anticipation through limited access or beta programs

### Phase 2: Community Development

1. **Design mutual benefit systems**: Ensure both referrers and new users gain value
2. **Build exclusive access tiers**: Create meaningful distinctions for your most engaged users
3. **Focus on value over promotion**: Prioritize audience growth over immediate monetization

### Phase 3: Scale Through Automation

1. **Embed sharing in user workflows**: Make referrals a natural extension of product use
2. **Create viral content formats**: Develop shareable assets that provide genuine utility
3. **Measure and optimize**: Track viral coefficients, not just traditional metrics

## Conclusion

TheSkimm's email list growth wasn't accidental—it resulted from a systematic approach that prioritized community building, provided genuine value, and created natural viral loops. The remarkable success of B2B companies like Morning Brew, Dropbox, Notion, and HubSpot demonstrates that these consumer-focused tactics translate effectively to business contexts.

The key insight is that theSkimm succeeded not by treating their newsletter as a product to be sold, but as a community to be built. B2B companies applying this philosophy—focusing on community over customers, content over campaigns, and value over volume—consistently achieve superior growth rates with lower acquisition costs.

For B2B companies seeking sustainable growth, theSkimm's playbook offers a proven alternative to expensive paid acquisition strategies. By building communities, creating viral content, and designing product-aligned incentive systems, businesses can transform their users into their most powerful growth engine.
