# Historical Business Terminology: Before "Startups" and Funding Distinctions

## Pre-"Startup" Business Terms

Before the term "startup" became widely adopted in the 1970s, new businesses were referred to using a variety of traditional terminology that reflected the nature of their activities and structure:[^1][^2][^3]

**Small Businesses and Independent Enterprises**: Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, new ventures were commonly called "small businesses" or "small enterprises". The Small Business Administration, established in 1953, defined a small business as one "independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field".[^4]

**Merchants and Traders**: Historically, new business ventures were often categorized as "merchants" or "traders." A merchant was defined as "someone who buys and sells goods or services for profit," typically operating from a fixed location. Traders, on the other hand, were individuals who engaged in buying and selling, often with more mobility and shorter-term focus.[^5][^6]

**Entrepreneurial Ventures**: The term "entrepreneur" itself has much older origins, dating back to the 13th-century French verb "entreprendre," meaning "to undertake". By the 18th century, economist Richard Cantillon used "entrepreneur" to describe individuals who bore financial risks in business ventures. However, this remained primarily an academic term rather than common vernacular.[^7][^8][^9]

**New Establishments and Independent Ventures**: In government and academic contexts, new businesses were often referred to as "new establishments," "independent ventures," or simply "new companies". The focus was typically on their size (number of employees or revenue) rather than their growth potential or innovative nature.[^4]

**The Evolution to "Startup"**: The modern term "startup" first appeared in business contexts in 1976, when Forbes magazine used it to describe "the unfashionable business of investing in startups in the electronic data processing field". The term gained widespread adoption during the 1990s dot-com boom.[^2][^3][^10]

## Distinguishing Externally-Funded vs. Bootstrapped Businesses

The distinction between externally-funded and self-funded businesses has become increasingly important as different funding models have evolved. Here are the most effective ways to differentiate between these approaches:

### Terminology and Definitions

**Bootstrapped/Self-Funded Companies**: These businesses grow using personal savings, reinvested revenue, or other internal resources without external investment. The term "bootstrapping" comes from the phrase "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps," referring to achieving success without external help.[^11][^12][^13]

**Externally-Funded Companies**: These businesses receive capital from outside sources such as angel investors, venture capitalists, or institutional investors in exchange for equity or debt obligations.[^12][^11]

### Key Distinguishing Characteristics

**Ownership and Control**: Bootstrapped companies maintain full ownership and control over business decisions, while externally-funded companies typically give up some equity and decision-making power to investors.[^11][^12]

**Growth Trajectory**: External funding is often associated with rapid scaling and aggressive growth targets, while bootstrapped companies typically grow more gradually and sustainably.[^14][^11]

**Risk Distribution**: Self-funded entrepreneurs bear the full personal financial risk, while externally-funded businesses share financial risk with investors.[^12][^11]

**Market Approach**: Externally-funded startups often target large, scalable markets with winner-take-all dynamics, while bootstrapped businesses may focus on niche markets or sustainable, profitable operations.[^11]

### Professional Terminology

In modern business and investment contexts, the most commonly accepted distinctions are:

- **"Venture-backed" or "VC-funded"** for companies receiving institutional investment
- **"Angel-funded"** for companies receiving investment from high-net-worth individuals
- **"Bootstrapped" or "self-funded"** for companies growing organically without external capital
- **"Organic growth"** to describe expansion funded through revenue rather than investment[^12]


### Industry-Specific Considerations

The terminology may vary by industry and context. In technology sectors, the distinction between "funded" and "bootstrapped" startups is particularly important due to different expectations around growth rates, exit strategies, and scalability. In traditional industries, businesses might still be referred to simply as "small businesses" regardless of their funding source.[^3]

Understanding these distinctions helps clarify the different paths entrepreneurs can take and the trade-offs involved in each approach. The choice between bootstrapping and external funding often depends on factors such as the business model, market opportunity, personal risk tolerance, and long-term goals of the founders.[^11][^12]
