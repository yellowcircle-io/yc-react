# Is this the proper usage of nor:

There is a placeholder, but it is not branded nor specific to Partner

Your example sentence:

> There is a placeholder, but it is not branded nor specific to Partner

This usage of "nor" is not considered standard or proper in modern English. Here’s why:

- "Nor" typically follows "neither"—for example, "neither branded nor specific".[^1][^3][^5][^7]
- When using "not," the parallel negative structure generally takes "or," not "nor." The standard structure would be:

> "...but it is not branded or specific to Partner".[^4]
- "Nor" can sometimes be used after a negative clause, but mainly for parallelism with verbs, not for adjectives or nouns as in your example. In everyday writing, most style guides recommend "or" unless you explicitly start with "neither."[^8][^4]

Therefore, the proper phrasing is:
> There is a placeholder, but it is not branded or specific to Partner

If you want to use "nor," you’d have to revise to:
> There is a placeholder, but it is neither branded nor specific to Partner.[^3][^5][^7][^1]

In summary: use "or" in your original sentence unless you pair "nor" with "neither" at the start.
