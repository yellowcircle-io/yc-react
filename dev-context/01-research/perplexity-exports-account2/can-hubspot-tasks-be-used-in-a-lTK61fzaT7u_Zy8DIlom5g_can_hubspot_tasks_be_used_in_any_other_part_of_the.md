# Can HubSpot Tasks be used in any other part of the system besides the CRMUI?

Yes, HubSpot Tasks can be used in multiple parts of the system beyond just the CRM user interface (CRM UI). Here are the main ways tasks are supported across HubSpot:

- **Tasks Index Page:** You can create, view, and manage tasks directly from the tasks index page in the CRM section. This centralizes all tasks across your account[^1].
- **Object Index Pages:** Tasks can be created on index pages for various objects, such as Contacts, Companies, Deals, Tickets, and Custom Objects. You can create a task for a single record or in bulk for multiple records at once[^1].
- **Individual Records:** From any individual record (like a contact, company, or deal), you can create a task associated with that specific record by clicking the "Task" button in the left panel[^1].
- **Workflows and Automation:** Tasks can be automatically created or updated using workflows. For example, you can set up a workflow to create a task when a deal moves to a certain stage or after a period of inactivity[^2][^1].
- **Mobile App:** HubSpot offers a mobile app where you can create and manage tasks on the go[^1].
- **Integrations and Extensions:** HubSpot integrates with tools like Gmail (via the HubSpot Sales extension), allowing you to create tasks directly from your email interface[^3].
- **Webhooks and External Systems:** With Operations Hub Professional or higher, you can use webhooks to trigger task creation or updates from external systems, further extending task management beyond the native UI[^4].

In summary, HubSpot Tasks are not limited to the CRM UI and can be accessed and managed from various points within the platform, as well as through integrations and automation tools.
