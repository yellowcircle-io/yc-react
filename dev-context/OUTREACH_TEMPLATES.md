# Outreach Templates - GTM Strategic Audit

**Purpose:** Ready-to-use templates for warm outreach, cold outreach, and follow-ups
**Last Updated:** November 26, 2025

## WARM OUTREACH (Former Colleagues, Network Connections)

### Template 1: Direct Reconnection

**Subject:** Quick update + something I think you'd find interesting

```
Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Wanted to share a quick update—I've transitioned out of [Rho/previous company] and am now doing independent GTM consulting.

I spent the last [X] months documenting everything I learned about why marketing ops gets stuck at scaling companies. Turns out there are patterns that repeat everywhere:
- $2.5M/year in technical debt nobody quantifies
- 300 workflows that should be 30
- Attribution systems that give 3 different answers

I wrote a long piece on it if you're curious: [Article link]

Two asks:
1. If you know anyone feeling "stuck" with their GTM infrastructure, I'd love an intro
2. If [Company] is experiencing any of this, happy to do a quick diagnostic call—no pitch, just perspective

Either way, would love to catch up properly. Coffee or call sometime?

[Name]
```

### Template 2: Referral Ask

**Subject:** Quick favor?

```
Hey [Name],

Quick one for you—I'm building out a consulting practice focused on GTM infrastructure audits (helping companies figure out why their marketing ops feels stuck).

Given your role at [Company/Network], I'm wondering if you know anyone dealing with:
- HubSpot/Salesforce integration headaches
- Attribution chaos (multiple conflicting systems)
- "Why does everything take so long?" syndrome
- Considering hiring marketing ops but not sure what role

If anyone comes to mind, I'd really appreciate an intro. Happy to return the favor however I can.

Thanks!

## COLD OUTREACH (Targeted Companies)

### Template 3: Pain Point Lead

**Subject:** The 45-minute problem at [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [hiring for MOps / scaling marketing / recently raised]. Companies at your stage often hit the same wall:

Speed-to-lead SLA looks great, but leads still go cold. Why? Usually a 45+ minute data lag nobody measured.

I spent [X] years inside scaling B2B companies watching this pattern repeat—and I wrote a detailed breakdown of why it happens: [Article link]

If "why does everything take longer than it should?" sounds familiar, I'd love 15 minutes to share what I've seen work.

No pitch—just diagnosis.

[Name]
```

### Template 4: Hiring Trigger

**Subject:** Before you hire that [Lifecycle/MOps/Demand Gen] role...

```
Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] is hiring a [role title]. Quick insight from the trenches:

I watched a company interview 3 perfect candidates for "Lifecycle Marketing" and reject all of them for "weak demand gen skills." The problem? Leadership wanted demand gen, but the JD said lifecycle.

3 failed hiring cycles. 6-month delay. $240K wasted.

Before you go too far down the hiring path, might be worth a 15-minute sanity check on role definition. I've seen this pattern enough to spot it quickly.

Happy to do a quick call—just perspective sharing, no sales pitch.

[Name]
```

### Template 5: Article-First Outreach

**Subject:** Wrote this thinking of companies like [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

I just published a piece called "Why Your GTM Sucks"—it's everything I learned watching marketing ops break at scaling B2B companies.

The TL;DR:
- Technical debt costs $500K-2.5M/year (but nobody quantifies it)
- 300 workflows that should be 30
- Attribution with 3 different answers
- "Real-time" data with 45-minute lags

I wrote it thinking of companies at [Company]'s stage—growing fast, probably inheriting some infrastructure debt, trying to figure out what's actually slowing things down.

If any of it resonates: [Article link]

And if you want to talk through what you're seeing at [Company], happy to do a quick diagnostic call.

## RESPONSE HANDLING

### "Not interested right now"
```
Totally understand, [Name]. If things change down the road, feel free to reach out. In the meantime, I'll keep sharing insights on LinkedIn if you want to stay connected.
```

### "We're already working with consultants"
```
Makes sense—good to have help. If you ever want a second opinion on root causes vs. symptoms, I'm happy to do a quick diagnostic. Sometimes fresh eyes help. Either way, good luck with the project.
```

### "This is expensive"
```
I hear you. For context, one company I worked with was about to spend $32K on an audit + $288K/year on tools. I showed them a $6K approach that solved 95% of the problem.

The audit pays for itself if it saves you from one wrong hire or tool purchase. But I understand if budget is tight—happy to revisit when timing is better.
```

### "Can you just fix our HubSpot?"
```
I could, but I'd be treating symptoms. The real question is: why do you have 300 workflows that should be 30? If we fix the root cause, the HubSpot optimization becomes much simpler.

Happy to chat through what you're seeing—might be a quick fix, might be deeper. 15 minutes would tell us.
```
