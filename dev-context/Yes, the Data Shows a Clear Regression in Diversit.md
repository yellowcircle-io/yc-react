# Yes, the Data Shows a Clear Regression in Diversity

The chart comparison you referenced does indeed indicate a **significant regression in diversity**, particularly when examined through longitudinal trends rather than cross-sectional snapshots. While Y Combinator and other accelerators show varying diversity levels at different points in time, the broader venture capital ecosystem has experienced a dramatic decline in funding to underrepresented founders since 2020.

## The Post-George Floyd Surge and Subsequent Collapse

The most striking evidence of regression comes from tracking funding to Black founders over time. Following George Floyd's murder in May 2020, venture capital funding to Black entrepreneurs **increased by 43%**, reaching a peak of **1.3% of total VC funding in 2021**. However, this progress has not only stalled—it has sharply reversed.[^1][^2][^3]

### The Numbers Tell a Stark Story

**Black Founder Funding Decline:**

- **2020**: 0.6% of total VC funding
- **2021**: 1.3% (peak year)
- **2022**: 1.0%
- **2023**: 0.48% (lowest in recent history)
- **2024 H1**: 0.32% (continuing downward trend)

This represents a **75% decline from the 2021 peak**. The 2023 figure of 0.48% (\$661 million out of \$136 billion) is the lowest percentage recorded in recent history, with the decline accelerating in the latter half of the year.[^1][^4][^5]

### Quarterly Breakdown Reveals Accelerating Decline

The quarterly data for 2023 shows the regression accelerating:

- **Q1-Q2 2023**: 0.74%
- **Q3 2023**: 0.13%
- **Q4 2023**: 0.20%

The first half of 2024 continued this downward trajectory with Black founders raising just **\$228 million out of almost \$79 billion** (0.32%), representing nearly a **60% drop from 2023 levels**.[^5][^6]

## The Nature of Tokenistic Investment

Research from Cornell University and Columbia Business School reveals that the 2020-2021 surge was largely driven by **tokenistic investments**. The study of 150,000 founders and 30,000 investors found that:[^2][^3][^7]

**New Investors Drove the Surge**: The funding increase was concentrated among venture capitalists who had **never previously invested in any Black entrepreneur**. These investors were **36% more likely to invest in a Black-founded startup** in the year after George Floyd's murder.[^3][^7][^8][^2]

**Shallow Engagement**: These new investors were:

- **Less likely to invest in more than one Black-founded startup**
- **15% less likely to take board seats**
- **More likely to make one-time investments** rather than developing sustained relationships[^2][^3]

**Elite Founders Opted Out**: Interestingly, **top-tier Black founders often bypassed this group of new investors**, potentially due to stronger bargaining power and skepticism toward investors with no prior track record of funding Black entrepreneurs.[^2]

## Female Founder Regression

The diversity regression extends beyond racial demographics to gender representation:

**Declining Female Founder Percentages:**

- **2022**: 15.1% of newly incorporated startup founders were women
- **2023**: 13.2% (lowest in recent years)
- **2024**: Female-only founding teams received just **1% of VC funding**[^9][^10][^11]

This decline has affected **nearly every major sector** of the startup ecosystem, with education being particularly notable as it traditionally had the highest percentage of female founders.[^9]

## Y Combinator's Mixed Signals

Looking specifically at Y Combinator's data over time reveals inconsistent progress:

**Y Combinator Black Founder Representation:**

- **2015**: 4% Black founders
- **2022**: 3% Black founders
- This represents a **25% decline** despite years of diversity initiatives[^12][^13]

**Female Founder Representation at YC:**

- **2015**: 23% of startups had at least one female founder
- **2022**: 15% of companies have a woman founder
- This is a **35% decline** over seven years[^13][^12]

The introduction of a "multiracial" category in 2022 (8% of founders) may account for some shifts in traditional demographic categories, but the overall trend suggests limited progress.[^13]

## Systemic Factors Driving Regression

### The "Great Rollback"

Black founders have started calling this phenomenon **"the Great Rollback"** as companies continue cutting their DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives. Several factors contribute to this regression:[^1]

**Market Conditions**: While overall VC funding dropped 36% in 2022, financing for Black businesses saw a **steeper drop of 45%**. The 2023 downturn disproportionately affected diverse founders, with funding declining faster than the overall market.[^14][^6][^1]

**Legal and Political Pressure**: The June 2023 Supreme Court decision striking down affirmative action in college admissions coincided with a reevaluation of diversity initiatives across industries. The Fearless Fund was forced to close its grant contest for Black women business owners following a lawsuit alleging discrimination.[^2][^5]

**Investor Retreat**: As market conditions tightened, many investors who made tokenistic investments during 2020-2021 retreated to their traditional networks and investment patterns.[^3][^2]

### Deal Flow Collapse

Beyond funding amounts, the number of deals has also declined dramatically:

- **2024 Q2**: Only **28 funding deals** for Black-founded startups (lowest since 2019)
- **2024 H1**: **66 total deals** (53% drop from first half of 2023)
- **No single deal achieved more than \$25 million** in the first six months of 2024[^5]


## Regional Variations

The regression varies by geography, with some traditionally diverse markets showing particularly steep declines:

- **Atlanta**: Black founder funding share dropped to **1.5% in 2023** from a high of **8.9% in 2021**[^15]


## The Broader Context: Why This Matters

### Performance Data Contradicts Funding Patterns

The regression is particularly troubling given consistent evidence that diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones:

- **Diverse founding teams deliver 30-35% higher ROI**[^16]
- **38% of unicorn companies had at least one non-white founder**
- **44% were founded by first or second-generation immigrants**[^17]


### Institutional vs. Individual Progress

While some accelerators like Techstars show better diversity metrics through targeted programs (22% Black founders in 2023), the overall ecosystem regression suggests that **institutional change has not taken hold**. The temporary nature of the post-2020 surge indicates that social pressure alone is insufficient to create lasting transformation.[^18]

## Conclusion: Clear Evidence of Regression

The data unequivocally shows that diversity in venture capital has regressed significantly since 2021. The brief surge following George Floyd's murder has not only ended but reversed dramatically, with funding to Black founders now at historic lows and female founder representation declining across multiple metrics.

This regression is particularly concerning because:

1. **It contradicts business performance data** showing diverse teams generate superior returns
2. **It represents a retreat from stated industry commitments** made during 2020-2021
3. **It suggests tokenistic rather than systematic change** in investment patterns
4. **It coincides with broader attacks on diversity initiatives** across multiple sectors

The comparison chart you referenced captures just one moment in time, but the longitudinal data reveals a clear pattern: any progress made toward diversity in venture capital has been largely temporary and superficial, with the ecosystem now showing worse representation than before the 2020 social justice movement began.
