## Mobile Email Engagement (2025 vs 2015)

### 2015 (LiveIntent Report Baseline)
- Mobile email opens: **52%**
- Desktop dominance still present
- Early mobile adoption phase

### 2025 (Current Industry Data)
- Mobile email opens: **55%** (3% increase over 10 years)
- **85%** of online users check email via mobile globally
- **90%** in the United States
- Mobile open rate: **41.9%** vs Desktop: **16.2%**
- Mobile generates **$1B+** in revenue
- **50%** of non-optimized emails deleted within seconds

**Key Insight:** Mobile didn't just win—desktop became irrelevant. Yet we still design org charts like it's 2010.

## Marketing Operations Role Misalignment (2024-2025)

### Alignment Statistics
- **53%** of organizations experience sales/marketing hand-off misalignment
- Only **11%** have successful alignment and effective hand-off
- Only **30%** of sales professionals believe teams are closely aligned
- **48%** of enterprises still struggle with alignment

### Root Causes (Top 3)
1. **38%** - Poor communication between teams
2. **30%** - Misalignment on goals or strategies
3. **27%** - Lack of sales input on marketing content

### Professional Satisfaction (2024 vs 2023)
- Role clarity: **Down 9%**
- Feeling valued: **Down 5%**
- Fair pay perception: **Down 8%**
- Strategic voice: Only **37%** report having strategic influence

### Financial Impact
- Sales/marketing misalignment costs: **$1 TRILLION annually**
- Average revenue loss: **10% per year**
- "Unclear roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority" = biggest factor

**Key Insight:** It's not a tools problem. It's a "who owns what" problem.

## Martech Stack Size (2025)

### By Company Size
- **Small/Mid-Market B2B:** 12-20 tools (92% have ≤20 tools)
- **Average (all sizes):** 10 tools in sales/marketing stack
- **Enterprise:** 90-120 tools on average

### Trends
- **62.1%** use more tools than 2 years ago
- Only **49%** of tools are actively used (massive bloat)
- AI-powered specialized apps driving stack growth

### 2015 Comparison (LiveIntent Era)
- Average stack: 5-7 tools
- **Growth:** 2-4x increase in 10 years

**Key Insight:** We tripled our tool count but not our alignment. More tools = more chaos when nobody owns the data.

---

## Marketing Operations Time Allocation (2024-2025)

### Current Reality
- **KTLO (Keep the Lights On) work dominates** MOps teams
- Most time: Managing tech, campaign ops, pulling reports, urgent issues
- Limited strategic contribution despite function maturity
- Only **37%** have strategic voice in organization

### Future Outlook (2025+)
- AI, data/measurement strategies, and customer experience tools point toward more strategy focus
- But operational bottlenecks still limit momentum
- MOps professionals "feeling stretched" with declining satisfaction metrics

**Key Insight:** You hired strategists and turned them into firefighters. Then wondered why velocity dropped.

## Platform Migration Costs (2024-2025)

### Direct Costs
- Implementation fees: **20-50%** of first-year software costs
- Covers: Setup, configuration, data migration, system integration
- Timeline: **Months to a year** depending on database size and assets

### Hidden Costs (Often Overlooked)
- Multi-month commitment of team resources
- Organizational focus diverted from revenue activities
- AI integration adds new complexity layer (2025)
- Risk of repeated migrations (didn't fix root cause)

### Cost Drivers
- Contact database size
- Number of assets being migrated
- Integration complexity with existing systems
- AI-powered features (new in 2024-2025)

**Key Insight:** Migration costs 20-50% more than the license. But that's not the real cost. The real cost is 18 months of your MOps team not building anything strategic.

## Technical Debt Impact (2024-2025)

### IT Budget Impact
- **20-40%** of IT budgets consumed by technical debt issues
- Martech market: **$131B (2023)** → **$215B projected (2027)**
- **13.3% CAGR** growth

### Key Challenges
- **47%** of martech decision-makers cite stack complexity as key blocker
- System and data integration challenges prevent value extraction
- Bloated stacks hinder data sharing and inflate costs

### 2025 Rationalization Focus
- "Continuous rationalization" vs one-time cleanup
- Balance: Over-consolidation vs excessive atomization
- Goal: Streamline stacks while delivering cutting-edge tech

**Key Insight:** Your technical debt is eating 20-40% of IT budget. That's not a maintenance cost. That's what happens when nobody owned the architecture from day one.
