**A Strategic Consulting Practice + Digital Product Studio**

*Last Updated: December 10, 2025*

---

## For Humans: Quick Scan

### What is yellowCircle?

**yellowCircle** is a GTM (Go-To-Market) strategy and marketing operations consulting practice founded by Christopher Cooper. It combines:

1. **Consulting Services** - Strategic audits for B2B companies ($1.5K - $5K engagements)
2. **Digital Products** - The **Unity Platform** ecosystem (UnityNOTES, UnityMAP, UnitySTUDIO)
3. **Thought Leadership** - "Own Your Story" article series on marketing operations dysfunction

### The Problem We Solve

> "Stop buying tools to fix organizational problems."

Most B2B companies invest $50K-$200K/year in marketing technology while their teams struggle with:
- Role misalignment (marketing ops doing data analyst work)
- Technical debt ($2.5M+/year in hidden costs)
- Data architecture chaos (45-minute sync lags, 15% error rates)
- Attribution confusion (3+ implementations giving different answers)

### The Opportunity

- **$8.5B** marketing operations software market
- **53%** of marketing ops professionals report role misalignment
- **Only 11%** of companies successfully align marketing operations roles
- Post-COVID remote work has amplified GTM coordination challenges

### ✅ Architecture Capability: Email Capture → Journey (WORKING)

**Question Resolved:** Can email captures auto-enroll in UnityMAP journeys?

**Answer: YES - Fully functional.**

```
LeadGate/Footer/Assessment/SSO
        ↓
   createLead() → Firestore `leads`
        ↓
   onLeadCreated (Cloud Function)
        ↓
   Evaluate triggerRules
        ↓
   enroll_journey action → UnityMAP
        ↓
   Email via ESP (Resend/SendGrid)
```

**To Enable:**
1. Create welcome journey at `/outreach`
2. Create trigger rule at `/admin/trigger-rules`
3. Test end-to-end flow

**User Partitioning:** Currently single-tenant (yellowCircle internal). Multi-tenant workspace isolation designed for future.
