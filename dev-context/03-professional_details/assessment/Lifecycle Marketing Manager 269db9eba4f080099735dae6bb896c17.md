## Role Core Competencies (3 to 5)

- Explainer
    
    ### **Step 1: Build Core Competencies & Guiding Questions**
    
    **Competencies** are the *core capabilities* that enable someone to succeed in the role's environment and deliver outcomes—they reflect how someone thinks, executes, and adapts. Core competencies are **not** meant to define a single skill but rather their ability to make an impact.
    
    Each role should have a defined set of 3 to 5 **competencies** and associated **guiding questions** to help interviewers understand how to assess a candidate’s fit for the role. Think: what do we need to be sure of to hire this person?
    
    💡 Example:
    
    **Thrives in Ambiguity *(Competency)*** - Does this person have the ability to navigate uncertainty amidst ever-changing priorities? *(Guiding Question)*
    
    **Executive Influence *(Competency)*** - Can this candidate demonstrate subject matter expertise and communicate with impact to effectively support executive decision making? *(Guiding Question)*
    

| **Competency** | Guiding Question |
| --- | --- |
| Builder Mindset | Can the candidate not just inherit but build an email program from the ground up? Can they pivot quickly from V1 → V2 → V3, iterating and continually achieving new heights of excellence? |
| Customer-First Thinking | Is the candidate able to understand the unique pain points for each of our different customer segments, and how they want to be talked to? Can they subsequently understand how to build Comms sequences to fill those needs?  |
| Analytical Project Excellence | Does the candidate have experience running rigorously analytical email programs? Do they use data as a guiding principle for excellence? |
| Detail/Eye for Excellence | Can the candidate identify what a great email looks like? Can they aspire to reach for excellent design, copy, sequencing, etc? |
- **List Functional Skills Here (Job Requirements)**
    - Explainer
        
        **Functional skills** are the *tools and techniques* someone needs to do the job—like using Salesforce, writing SQL, or handling objections. These would be the concrete “role requirements” listed on a job description. We will then build an interview process designed to assess each of these functional skills with progressive complexity.
        
        💡 Example:
        
        5+ years managing a similar compliance function with strong subject matter expertise in BSA/AML, financial crimes, and banking/fair lending regulations within the banking, fintech, or financial services industry
        
        Extensive experience enhancing digital frameworks for AML/BSA risk at a bank or fintech and building out compliance monitoring, testing, and reporting
        
        Experience building and scaling a Third Party Risk Management program
        
    - Experience using data tools like like PostHog, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Looker.

## Interview Process

- Explainer
    
    Our goal in building intentional interview processes is to **hire the top 5% of the talent market and make talent density Rho’s competitive advantage.** This means maximizing excellent hires and **eliminating false positives**. Failing to plan effective interviews significantly increases the likelihood of making a bad hire.
    
    **Process Basics & Intent**
    
    Our interview process is split into 3 evaluative stages to ensure candidates are effectively assessed before reaching the most time-intensive round (multi-interviewer onsites).
    
    - **Initial Round:** Talent Screening
        
        Efficiently assesses whether a candidate meets baseline role requirements and begins Talent’s “Always Be Closing” process from first contact. This ensures that only qualified, engaged candidates move forward, saving time for hiring teams.
        
    - **Second Round:** Hiring Manager & (optional) Technical Screenings
        
        Hiring manager screens validate a candidate’s ability by *assessing deeper functional knowledge, problem-solving ability, and team-specific alignment*. Technical screenings (when applicable) provide objective evidence of a candidate’s proficiency in critical skills, ensuring that only capable candidates advance to onsites.
        
    - **Panel Round:** Onsites & (optional) Final Interviews
        
        Panels/Final Rounds provide a comprehensive evaluation by bringing together cross-functional perspectives to assess a candidate’s ability to succeed in the role and thrive within the team and company environment. They serve as critical data points and checks against the urgency + limited perspective of 1 or 2 interviewers. Hiring managers may elect to add a **Final Interview** with an executive or org leader following alignment from the primary panel interviewers.
        
    
    Each interview should have 2 or more conversation starters to create consistency when interviewing multiple candidates for the same role.
    
    *Note: You may extend the length of interviews in consultation with your talent team!
    

| **Stage (Length)** | **Interviewer** | **Assessing** (Add Competencies + Skills) | Questions or Conversation Starters (2 per interview) |

- Our data isn’t perfect for Rho - how do you improve the bar in spite of that? |
| Onsite Interview 1

## Candidate Sourcing Guidelines

| **Companies to target** | B2B preferred, and one with a complex diversity of different customer personas |
| --- | --- |
| **Companies to avoid** | To some extent B2C but not a deal breaker |
| **Example/ideal profiles** | Someone who has built a full lifecycle funnel (+retention) from the ground-up, ideally for a B2B Fintech/SaaS company. |
| **What skills gaps on your team can this hire help bridge?** | Commanding subject-matter expertise on lifecycle, and knowing exactly what to say at every different stage; expertise on SMS  |
| **How should we sell the role, its opportunity, and its challenges?** | Rho has never had a lifecycle expert on the Growth team. This is your opportunity to fully own and build a lifecycle program from the ground up, and putting lasting imprints on a company at a unique growth stage.

This role will be challenging for those looking to work on a big Comms team and want to simply inherit an email program. |
