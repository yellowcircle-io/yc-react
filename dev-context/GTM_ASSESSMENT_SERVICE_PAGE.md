## SERVICE DESCRIPTION (Long Form)

### The Problem

Your marketing ops feels stuck. Campaigns that should launch in days take weeks. Your attribution data doesn't match across systems. You've hired consultants, bought tools, and the problems persist.

**Sound familiar?**

- "Why can't we answer which channel drives revenue?"
- "Our speed-to-lead SLA is great, but leads still go cold"
- "We have 300 workflows and nobody knows what half of them do"
- "Every new campaign requires workarounds on top of workarounds"

**Here's what nobody tells you:** These aren't tool problems. They're organizational problems disguised as technical issues.

### What I Do

I've spent years inside scaling B2B companies watching the same patterns repeat:

- **$2.5M/year** in technical debt nobody quantified
- **45-minute data lags** when leadership thinks it's "real-time"
- **3+ failed hiring cycles** because the job description doesn't match what leadership actually wants
- **300+ workflows** that should be 30

I find the root causes—not the symptoms—and give you a clear path forward.

### The GTM Strategic Audit

A comprehensive assessment of your go-to-market infrastructure, delivered in 2-3 weeks.

**What You Get:**

1. **Discovery Deep-Dive** (2-hour session)
   - Current tech stack audit
   - Organizational structure review
   - Process pain point mapping

2. **Assessment Report** (10-15 pages)
   - Gap analysis with prioritized findings
   - Technical debt quantification (actual dollar cost)
   - Industry benchmark comparison

3. **Recommendations Roadmap**
   - 30/60/90 day action plan
   - Build vs. buy analysis for key decisions
   - Role alignment recommendations

**Investment:** $4,000 (intro rate) | $5,000 (standard)

**Optional Add-On:** Implementation support (+$5,000-10,000)

### Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** ($5M-50M ARR) feeling GTM friction
- **Companies that just hired** a VP Marketing or CRO and want to start clean
- **Teams using HubSpot + Salesforce** with integration headaches
- **Anyone who's been told** "just buy another tool" and knows that's not the answer

### Who This Is NOT For

- Companies looking for someone to manage their HubSpot day-to-day
- Teams that want a consultant to validate decisions already made
- Organizations not ready to hear hard truths about their structure

## VALUE PROPOSITIONS (For Different Audiences)

### For VP Marketing / CMO
> "I'll show you why campaigns take 3x longer than they should—and it's probably not the tools or the team. It's usually an architectural problem nobody quantified."

### For VP RevOps / CRO
> "Your speed-to-lead SLA looks great, but I'll show you why leads are still going cold. Hint: you're measuring the wrong part of the journey."

### For CEO / Founder
> "That $32K consultant audit? I'll show you why it's treating symptoms, not causes—and how a $6K approach solves 95% of the problem instead of 70%."

### For MOps Manager
> "300 workflows that should be 30. Three attribution fields that don't match. I've been there. Let me help you build the case for fixing it properly."

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We already have consultants/agencies"
> "Consultants get paid to find problems that require more consulting. I get paid to find root causes—even when the answer is 'fix your org chart, not your tech stack.'"

### "We just need someone to optimize HubSpot"
> "HubSpot optimization is treating symptoms. If you have 300 workflows, the problem isn't workflow design—it's why you needed 300 workarounds in the first place."

### "This sounds expensive"
> "One company I worked with was about to spend $32K on an audit + $288K/year on tools. I showed them a $6K approach that solved 95% of the problem. What's expensive is NOT knowing your root causes."

### "How is this different from other consultants?"
> "Most consultants have incentive to recommend ongoing engagements. I have incentive to solve your problem in one engagement so you refer me to others."

## PROOF POINTS / CREDIBILITY
