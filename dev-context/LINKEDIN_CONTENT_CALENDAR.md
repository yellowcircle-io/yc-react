# LinkedIn Content Calendar - 8 Week Plan

**Start Date:** November 27, 2025
**Goal:** Establish thought leadership, drive discovery calls
**Cadence:** 2-3 posts per week

---

## WEEK 1 (Nov 27 - Dec 1): TRANSITION ANNOUNCEMENT

### Post 1: Transition Announcement (Nov 27 - Wednesday)
**Type:** Personal Update
**Goal:** Announce availability, frame expertise

```
After [X years] building marketing operations infrastructure at scaling B2B companies, I'm taking on a new challenge: helping other teams avoid the $2.5M/year mistakes I've seen repeated everywhere.

What I learned inside a $400M fintech:
- 300+ workflows that should be 30
- 45-minute data lags that leadership thought were "real-time"
- 3 failed hiring cycles because the job description didn't match what leadership wanted

These aren't unique problems. They're patterns.

I'm now offering GTM Strategic Audits for B2B companies feeling stuck—finding the organizational problems hiding behind technical symptoms.

If "why does everything take so long?" sounds familiar, let's talk.

### Post 2: Article Share (Nov 29 - Friday)
**Type:** Content Share
**Goal:** Drive traffic to Article 1

```
I wrote 15,000 words on why your GTM probably sucks.

Not because of bad people or wrong tools—but because of organizational dysfunction that nobody talks about.

The TL;DR:
→ You're hiring for roles you don't actually need
→ Your "real-time" data has a 45-minute lag
→ Your attribution has 3 conflicting definitions
→ Your 300 workflows should be 30

If this resonates, you're not alone.

## WEEK 2 (Dec 2 - 8): CREDIBILITY BUILDING

### Post 3: Technical Debt Insight (Dec 3 - Tuesday)
**Type:** Insight/Framework
**Goal:** Establish expertise

```
I once calculated the technical debt at a scaling B2B company.

The number: $2.5M/year.

Here's how it breaks down:
- $1.2M: Campaigns delayed because "simple" changes break things
- $520K: Maintaining 300 workflows that should be 30
- $312K: Integration errors losing 15% of leads
- $240K: 3 failed hiring cycles (wrong role definition)
- $180K: Redundant tools nobody uses

Most companies never quantify this. They just feel "stuck."

Want to know your number? It's probably higher than you think.

### Post 4: Quote Post (Dec 5 - Thursday)
**Type:** Quotable Insight
**Goal:** Engagement, shareability

```
"300+ HubSpot workflows isn't a feature, it's a symptom.

When you have 23 different lead routing workflows, the real problem isn't routing logic—it's that your data is so unreliable you had to build 22 workarounds."

Stop optimizing the workarounds.
Fix why you needed them.

#MarketingOps #HubSpot
```

### Post 5: Hiring Insight (Dec 7 - Saturday)
**Type:** Story/Case Study
**Goal:** Demonstrate diagnostic ability

```
A company interviewed 3 candidates with perfect scores for Lifecycle Marketing.

Rejected all of them.

The reason? "Weak demand generation skills."

The problem? The job description was for Lifecycle Marketing. Leadership wanted Demand Generation. Nobody noticed the mismatch until 3 hiring cycles failed.

Before your next marketing hire, ask:
- Does the JD match what leadership actually expects?
- Are you measuring candidates against the right criteria?
- Do you know the difference between the roles?

You can't hire a plumber and expect electrical work.

## WEEK 3 (Dec 9 - 15): PROBLEM AWARENESS

### Post 6: Speed to Lead (Dec 10 - Tuesday)
**Type:** Counterintuitive Insight
**Goal:** Challenge assumptions

```
"Our speed-to-lead SLA is under 5 minutes!"

Cool. But what are you actually measuring?

Most companies measure: Lead in Salesforce → Sales touches lead
What actually matters: User shows intent → Meaningful interaction

I've seen companies with "great" speed-to-lead where:
- User abandons signup at 10:00 AM
- Data syncs to warehouse at 10:45 AM
- Syncs to Salesforce at 10:55 AM
- Marketing email sends at 11:00 AM
- User already moved on

Your SLA looks good because you're measuring the wrong thing.

### Post 7: Attribution Chaos (Dec 12 - Thursday)
**Type:** Problem Identification
**Goal:** Resonate with pain point

```
"Which marketing channel drives the most revenue?"

If your answer involves:
- "Well, it depends which field you look at..."
- "The dashboard says one thing, the report says another..."
- "We have 3 different attribution implementations..."

You have an attribution problem.

Not a tool problem. Not a UTM discipline problem.
A "nobody owns the truth" problem.

The fix isn't buying an attribution platform.
The fix is choosing ONE source of truth and sunsetting the rest.

#Attribution #MarketingAnalytics #B2B
```

### Post 8: Consultant Critique (Dec 14 - Saturday)
**Type:** Contrarian Take
**Goal:** Differentiation

```
Unpopular opinion: Most MarTech consultants are incentivized to make your problems worse.

Here's why:

Consultant gets $32K for audit.
Consultant finds problems.
Consultant recommends... more consulting.

They're not incentivized to say:
"Fire us and hire 2 Marketing Ops people instead."

Or:
"This is an org chart problem, not a HubSpot problem."

Or:
"You don't need a $288K/year tool. You need a $6K fix."

Before hiring a consultant, ask:
How are they incentivized to answer?

## WEEK 4 (Dec 16 - 22): SOLUTION POSITIONING

### Post 9: Build vs Buy (Dec 17 - Tuesday)
**Type:** Framework Share
**Goal:** Establish methodology

```
Before you buy ANY MarTech tool, ask 4 questions:

1. Is this a TOOL problem or an ORG problem?
2. Will this fix the ROOT CAUSE or just a SYMPTOM?
3. Do we have CAPACITY to implement and maintain it?
4. What's the TOTAL cost over 3 years?

Example:
Problem: "300+ workflows, everything is slow"
Tool Solution: $32K audit + $60K/year platform
Root Cause: No schema governance, workflows proliferate
Better Solution: Fix governance, workflows consolidate naturally

Sometimes the $6K fix beats the $288K platform.

```

### Post 10: Service Soft Launch (Dec 19 - Thursday)
**Type:** Offer Introduction
**Goal:** Generate inquiries

```
I've been doing GTM Strategic Audits for B2B companies feeling stuck.

What it is:
- 2-3 week comprehensive assessment
- Technical debt quantification (actual $ cost)
- Root cause diagnosis (not symptom treatment)
- 30/60/90 day action plan

What it's not:
- HubSpot optimization
- Ongoing retainer
- Validation of decisions already made

If "why does everything take so long?" is your question, I probably have an answer.

DM me or comment "audit" if you want to learn more.
