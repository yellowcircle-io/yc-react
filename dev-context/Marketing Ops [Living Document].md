# Marketing / Growth / Ops Organization:

RE: Role and Responsibilities. OKRs/Goals for each department. There is some ambiguity, but it could likely be navigated. My concern centers on what leadership's expectations are – e.g., the Lifecycle seems to be misaligned strategically. For instance, based on Tommy's feedback regarding the candidates, it appears that the role might be better framed as Demand Generation.

KEY QUESTIONS:

* What team owns data infrastructure?   
* What team owns tool acquisition/What team owns experimentation (differentiation of experiments)  
* How does the org support MOF/BOF   
  * Tommy seems focused on TOF/Sales Pipeline  
    * Lifecycle typically is focused on Middle to Bottom
