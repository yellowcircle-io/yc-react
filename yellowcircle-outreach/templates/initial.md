## Template Variations

### A: Funding Trigger

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Saw you just raised {{fundingRound}} — congrats. Scaling GTM ops is usually the next headache.

I help B2B companies fix misaligned sales/marketing stacks. Recently helped a similar company identify $2.5M in hidden operational costs and reduce attribution setup time by 60%.

Two questions:
1. Is GTM alignment a current priority at {{company}}?
2. Who handles marketing ops strategy there?

Either way, happy to share the audit framework I use (free).

### B: Hiring Trigger

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Noticed {{company}} is hiring a {{role}}. That role is brutal to fill — most candidates can execute but can't architect.

I spent 10 years doing exactly this. Built attribution systems, marketing automation, fixed broken stacks.

Would it be useful if I shared the questions I'd ask in that interview? Helps filter faster.

— Chris
```

### C: Content/LinkedIn Trigger

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Your {{contentType}} about {{topic}} resonated — especially {{specificPoint}}.

I work with B2B companies on exactly this. Most are dealing with:
- Attribution systems that don't actually attribute
- Sales and marketing pointing fingers
- Marketing ops spending 80% of time on fire drills

If any of that sounds familiar, happy to share what's working for my clients.

— Chris
```

### D: No Specific Trigger

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I help B2B companies fix broken GTM systems — the misalignment between sales and marketing that causes attribution nightmares, lead quality debates, and ops team burnout.

Recently helped a company uncover $2.5M in hidden operational costs. Turns out their "marketing automation" was mostly manual.

Quick question: Is GTM alignment something {{company}} is actively working on?

— Chris
