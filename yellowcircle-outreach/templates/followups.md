## Follow-Up 1: Day 3

**Subject:** `Re: quick question about {{company}}'s GTM`

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on my note about GTM alignment.

Here's a quick diagnostic I use with clients:
- Can you trace a closed deal back to the marketing touch that sourced it?
- How long does your monthly attribution report take?
- Do sales and marketing agree on lead qualification criteria?

If any of those made you wince, might be worth a 15-minute call.

**Key Elements:**
- Reference previous email (don't repeat)
- Add value with diagnostic
- Specific questions
- Low-commitment CTA
- < 100 words

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Last ping on this — don't want to be spammy.

If GTM operations isn't a priority right now, no worries. If it becomes one, here's my calendar: {{calendarLink}}

Also wrote this recently: "Why Your GTM Sucks" — covers the patterns I see across most B2B orgs. {{articleLink}}

Good luck with {{company}}'s growth.

## Sequence Timing

| Email | Day | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Initial | 0 | Introduce, spark interest |
| Follow-Up 1 | 3 | Add value, different angle |
| Follow-Up 2 | 10 | Close loop, offer resources |

**After Day 10:** Stop. May revisit in 3-6 months with new trigger.

## Response Templates

### Positive: "Yes, let's talk"

```
Great — here's my calendar: {{calendarLink}}

Looking forward to it.

— Chris
```

### Positive: "Tell me more"

```
Happy to elaborate.

Quick summary:
- GTM Strategic Audit ($4K) — find hidden costs and misalignment
- Implementation Support (custom) — help fix what the audit uncovers

Most clients start with the audit. 2-3 weeks, 10-15 page report.

Worth a quick call?

— Chris
```

### Referral: "Talk to someone else"

```
Perfect — thanks for the pointer.

Would you mind making an intro, or should I reach out cold and mention you?

— Chris
```

### Soft No: "Not right now"

```
Totally understand — timing is everything.

Mind if I check back in {{timeframe}}?

— Chris
```

### Hard No: "Not interested"

```
Appreciate the directness. Removing you from my list.

Best of luck with {{company}}.

— Chris

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. **"Just following up"** — Always add value
2. **Same message repeated** — Each touch needs new angle
3. **Too many follow-ups** — 2 max, then stop
4. **Aggressive language** — Never guilt or pressure
5. **Long emails** — Shorter with each follow-up
