  "complexity": "simple",

  "competitiveRationale": "Miro and Milanote use consistent elevation systems across their widgets. UnityNOTES nodes have ad-hoc shadow values. Standardizing creates visual hierarchy - resting, hover, selected, and dragging states should each have a distinct elevation level.",
  "relatedScope": "dev-context/SCOPE_UNITYNOTES_UIUX_IMPROVEMENTS.md",
  "scopeSection": "Feature Details > 2. Enhanced Card Design",
  "objective": "Standardize the shadow/elevation values across all node components to use a consistent 4-level system: rest (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)), hover (0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)), selected (0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)), and active/dragging (0 12px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)). Apply to StickyNode.jsx and TextNoteNode.jsx (which were excluded from IMP-001).",

  "pattern": {
    "description": "Update the boxShadow values in the root div's style object to match the standardized elevation system",
    "example": "boxShadow: selected ? '0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)' : isHovered ? '0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)' : '0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)'",
    "notes": "StickyNode uses color-tinted shadows when selected (e.g., colorScheme.border + '40'). Preserve this pattern - only update the non-selected shadows. TextNoteNode is large (71KB) - only modify the boxShadow line(s), nothing else."
  },
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "StickyNode.jsx default shadow updated from '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)' to '0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)'",
    "StickyNode.jsx hover shadow updated from '0 6px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)' to '0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)'",
    "StickyNode.jsx selected shadow preserved (color-tinted)",
