  "objective": "Improve the color picker dropdown in StickyNode.jsx and ColorSwatchNode.jsx. For StickyNode: increase swatch size from 28px to 32px, increase gap from 6px to 8px, add a subtle ring effect on hover (box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px), and increase padding from 8px to 10px. For ColorSwatchNode: improve the color swatch add panel layout with consistent sizing.",
