# Why Your GTM Sucks: The Human Cost of Operations Theater

*Part 1 of the Own Your Story series*

## The Meeting That Changed Everything

It's 9:47 AM on a Tuesday. You're in the fourth meeting of the day—a "GTM alignment sync" that somehow requires 23 people, three time zones, and a slide deck that would make McKinsey blush.

The SVP of Revenue is presenting a waterfall chart. Marketing is defending their MQL numbers. Sales is explaining why "pipeline coverage" isn't actually a leading indicator of anything except job security. And somewhere in the back, a product manager is wondering why they were invited at all.

This is Operations Theater.

## What Is Operations Theater?

Operations Theater is when the performance of work replaces the work itself. It's the organizational equivalent of actors rehearsing a play that will never premiere.

**The symptoms are unmistakable:**

- Meetings about meetings
- Dashboards no one reads
- Process documents that become instantly outdated
- Alignment sessions that create more misalignment
- KPIs chosen because they're measurable, not meaningful

## The Three Acts of GTM Failure

### Act 1: The Planning Paradox

Every company starts with good intentions. "We need to be more strategic." "Let's build a proper GTM motion." "It's time to professionalize our approach."

What follows is predictable:
- Hiring consultants to define an ICP
- Building elaborate scoring models
- Creating attribution systems that would make a particle physicist jealous
- Establishing "rules of engagement" that no one follows

The planning never stops because stopping would require executing. And execution is terrifying.

### Act 2: The Metrics Maze

Once the strategy is "defined," the measurement obsession begins.

Marketing tracks MQLs, SQLs, SAOs, pipeline contribution, influenced revenue, and engagement scores. Sales tracks activity metrics, conversion rates, and win/loss ratios. Customer Success tracks NPS, CSAT, health scores, and expansion revenue.

Everyone has their own dashboard. No one has the same numbers.

> "When you measure everything, you understand nothing."

The metrics maze exists because it provides cover. If the numbers are complicated enough, no one can prove you're failing. And if you're not failing, you must be succeeding.

### Act 3: The Attribution Wars

Finally, the inevitable conflict: Who gets credit?

- Marketing claims credit for the lead
- Sales claims credit for the relationship
- Product claims credit for the feature
- Success claims credit for the renewal

Everyone is right. No one is right. The customer, meanwhile, doesn't care about your attribution model. They just want their problem solved.

## The Real Problem

The real problem isn't your GTM strategy. It's not your tools, your team, or your market.

**The real problem is complexity addiction.**

Somewhere along the way, we started confusing sophistication with effectiveness. We built systems designed to impress rather than perform. We created processes that optimize for control rather than outcomes.

And the humans caught in the middle? They're burned out, disengaged, and spending 60% of their time in internal meetings.

## A Different Path

What if we stopped?

What if we:

1. **Simplified ruthlessly** - Every process, every metric, every meeting must justify its existence
2. **Trusted humans** - The best GTM motion is often just good people having real conversations
3. **Measured outcomes** - Revenue, retention, referrals. That's it.
4. **Built for speed** - Plans that take six months to execute are usually wrong by month two

## The Challenge

I'm not suggesting you burn it all down. I'm suggesting you ask one question:

**"Is this helping us sell, or helping us feel like we're selling?"**

If you can't answer confidently, you might be performing in Operations Theater.
