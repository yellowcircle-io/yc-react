THINK DEEP: SCOPE AND PLAN MODE THE FOLLOWING:

Cost and feasibility of implementing Gemini/Nano Banana 1/2 into AI image generation. Ability to optimize existing imagery via Nodes and UnitySTUDIO (photographer/creative use-case)
 
REVIEW THE FOLLOWING FOR NEXT STEPS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT/DEPLOY
- Outbound Motion Seed (source 50 prospects, send to 10 per day over next 5 days, track and tag)
- Claude Code autonomous/headless operation with Slack/SSH conversations
- Programmatic ad distribution: ⚠️ Complex (needs API integrations)
- Dynamic newsletter: ⚠️ Medium effort (UI exists, needs automation)
- Headshot sourcing: ⚠️ Medium (needs UX flow)
  
  #Then following:
  Re-review the current state for validating/scoping requirements for the following use-case scripts:

  1. Internal Use [yellowCircle Native] - a.) Develop journey(s) and ads via prompt. b.) Deploy Ads (scope
  feasibility of programmatic ad platform distribution [e.g. parity with Jeeva.ai]. c.)Execute Outbound prospecting
  motion d.) Track and tag inbound/returning leads and contacts, route to journey(s) e.) Deploy dynamic bi-weekly
  newsletter to engaged contacts/users based on their enriched data, ICP, and behavior

  2. Client A [Small Photography Studio] - I. PROJECT 1: a.) source actor/business prospects suitable/looking for headshots in Unity
  Generator b.) develop/generate email drip for prospects c. generate/refine existing instagram ads via UnitySTUDIO
  II. PROJECT 2: a.) use UnityNOTE to ideate/vision board film and personal projects b.) optimize and accelerate advanced photo edits via ai
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I. AI IMAGE GENERATION OPTIMIZATION
-Proceed with tiered implementation
-Ensure hard caps on usage (not to exceed $20 budget/monthly. Default to free – scope additional OpenSource/free fall-backs)

II. OUTBOUND MOTION
-Manual Curation is P3 and additive rather than foundational.
-Automation is critical for scale and validation 
-What prospect discovery APIs are needed? (Google Places, Hunter, PDL, etc should already be implemented)

III. CLAUDE CODE AUTONOMOUS OPERATION
- Hybrid solution with Option B and C

IV. PROGRAMMATIC AD DISTRIBUTION
-Disregard Reddit and Twitter
-Proceed with Meta, LinkedIn, and Google (ensure budget remains under $100/month total across all platforms – no platform to exceed $35/month)

V. DYNAMIC NEWSLETTER AUTOMATION
– Further scoping required
- Dynamic modules/content should include LiveIntent/Movable Ink type live content – weather, relevant news, etc. 
- Dynamic generation should have standard sections; however, content populates based on inbound signals and enrichment info
- This is the most manual and iterative task
- Complete this last/next week

VI. HEADSHOT SOURCING
- This can be drastically simplied. 
- Should only pull from uploaded CSV and Google Places 
- To be pushed into Unity Generator for UnityMAP execution
- Would need toggles/options to allow user to set use-cases/modes for setting sample and seed data/outputs (partially implement at present)

VII.
- Confirmed, relevant responses above

---

Confirm execution ready. Add APIs as needed.
Provide full/updated Cost Projections

> Is the above updated in Testing Prep doc to ensure integrity going-forward? What is the status of Gemini/Image
  Generation Update?

    The following are corrected Priorities:
    P1: 1. Automate Contact Import 2. Configure API Keys 3. Test Functions 4. Prepare Ads 5. Claude Autonomous
    P2: 1. Launch Paid and Outbound Motions

    NEXT WEEK/AFTERWARDS
    ---
    P3: 1. Firestore Security Rules 2. Dynamic Newsletter
    
    
THINK DEEP - FEEDBACK/DIRECTIVES: 
1. Assist with remaining Slack Integration tokens/setup
2. Complete functions for Montreal Trip Planner
3. Test ESP Infrastructure for all ESPs (ensure delivery, tracking, and contact dashboard metrics)
4. Comet should be Chromium-based, find in Applications and assest in deploying execution path
5. Progressive and programmatically test Montreal Test and the following use-cases: 
  A. Internal Use [yellowCircle Native] - a.) Develop journey(s) and ads via prompt. b.) Deploy Ads (scope
  feasibility of programmatic ad platform distribution [e.g. parity with Jeeva.ai]. c.)Execute Outbound prospecting
  motion d.) Track and tag inbound/returning leads and contacts, route to journey(s) e.) Deploy dynamic bi-weekly
  newsletter to engaged contacts/users based on their enriched data, ICP, and behavior

  B. Client A [Small Photography Studio] - I. PROJECT 1: a.) source actor/business prospects suitable/looking for headshots in Unity
  Generator b.) develop/generate email drip for prospects c. generate/refine existing instagram ads via UnitySTUDIO
  II. PROJECT 2: a.) use UnityNOTE to ideate/vision board film and personal projects b.) optimize and accelerate advanced photo edits via ai

• Update cost projection based on current infrastructure and integrations
• Reassess the status of programmatic Ads (include mechanisms for Display Ads and CTV)
• Assist in developing the mechanisms for evoving Claude Code Autonomy for continuous refactoring, inspection, and overall improvement of yellowCircle site and Outreach functions
• Ensure all functions for client are accessible for admins. 
• Scope Admins logins as users/clients
